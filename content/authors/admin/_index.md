I obtained my BSc in biotechnology from the Sun Yat-sen University in 2015. And in 2020, I completed my PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology (advisor: Prof. Chung-I Wu) at the Sun Yat-sun University. During my PhD studies, I became much interested in the theoretical population genetics and specialized in computational biology and mathematical modelling. My PhD’s work is focused on the integration of theoretical population genetics and computation models with genomic data of cancer and normal tissues. I’m interested in exploring how mutation, selection, migration and other evolutionary driving forces to affect tumorigenesis, cancer metastasis, tumor heterogeneity and aging. 

In addition to somatic evolution, I’m interested in theoretical aspects of traditional evolutionary processes, including the evolution of sex, how recombination and beneficial mutations affect the fitness dynamics of a population, rigorous characterization of Hill-Robertson effect. Recently, I’m studying the origin and early evolution of COVID-19, the founder effect in COVID-19 outbreaks.
