{{< figure src="ohtaRatchet.jpg" title="Accumulation of deleterious mutations by Muller’s ratchet (MR) and Ohta’s ratchet (OR)" >}}

It is generally accepted that the absence of recombination reduces the efficacy of natural selection for, or against, mutations. A special case is Muller’s Ratchet (MR) whereby non-recombining genomes experience irreversible fitness decline due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations. MR has been a main hypothesis for sexual reproduction as well as many other biological phenomena. We now ask whether the fitness decline can indeed be stopped if an asexual population turns sexual to become recombining. The possible fitness decline under recombination is referred to as Ohta’s Ratchet (OR). In comparison, MR is more effective in driving fitness reduction than OR, but only in a restricted parameter space of mutation rate, population size and selection. Outside of this space, the two ratchets are equally effective or, alternatively, neither is sufficiently powerful. Furthermore, beneficial mutations can affect the population fitness, which may diverge between the two ratchets, but only in a small parameter space. Since recombination plays a limited role in driving fitness decline, the operation of MR could be far less common in nature than believed. A companion report (see Supplement) surveying the biological phenomena attributed to MR indeed suggests the alternative explanations to be generally more compelling.
