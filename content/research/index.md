**On the founder effect in COVID-19 outbreaks: how many infected travelers may have started them all?**
{{< figure src="NSR_sars2Founder.jpg" title="Schematic diagram of viral population divergence among regions" >}}

How many incoming travelers (I0 at time 0, equivalent to the ‘founders’ in evolutionary genetics) infected
with SARS-CoV-2 who visit or return to a region could have started the epidemic of that region? I0 would
be informative about the initiation and progression of epidemics. To obtain I0, we analyze the genetic
divergence among viral populations of different regions. By applying the ‘individual-output’ model of
genetic drift to the SARS-CoV-2 diversities, we obtain I0 <10, which could have been achieved by one
infected traveler in a long-distance flight.The conclusion is robust regardless of the source population, the
continuation of inputs (It for t>0) or the fitness of the variants.With such a tiny trickle of human
movement igniting many outbreaks, the crucial stage of repressing an epidemic in any region should,
therefore, be the very first sign of local contagion when positive cases first become identifiable.The
implications of the highly ‘portable’ epidemics, including their early evolution prior to any outbreak, are
explored in the companion study. 

**A theoretical exploration of the origin and early evolution of a pandemic**
{{< figure src="virusOrigin.jpg" title="Origin and early evolution of a pandemic" >}}

A virus that that can cause a global pandemic must be highly adaptive to human conditions. Such adaptation is not likely to have emerged suddenly but, instead, may have evolved step by step with each step favored by natural selection. It is thus necessary to have a theory about the origin so we know what we will be searching for. Here, we propose such a model whereby evolution occurs in both the virus and the hosts (where the evolution is somatic; i.e., in the immune system). The hosts comprise three groups – the wild animal hosts, the nearby human population and farther-away human populations. The theory suggests that the conditions under which the pandemic has initially evolved are: i) an abundance of wild animals in the place of origin (PL0); ii) a nearby human population of low density; iii) frequent and long-term animal-human contacts to permit step-by-step evolution; iv) a level of herd immunity in the animal and human hosts. In this model, the evolving virus may have regularly spread out of PL0 although such invasions often fail, leaving sporadic cases of early infections. The place of the first epidemic (PL1), where humans are immunologically naïve to the virus, is likely a distance away from PL0. Finally, more theoretical models will need to be developed to guide the search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 as only a correct model can guide a successful search. 

**Sex, fitness decline and recombination – Muller’s ratchet vs. Ohta’s ratchet**

{{< figure src="ohtaRatchet.jpg" title="Accumulation of deleterious mutations by Muller’s ratchet (MR) and Ohta’s ratchet (OR)" >}}

It is generally accepted that the absence of recombination reduces the efficacy of natural selection for, or against, mutations. A special case is Muller’s Ratchet (MR) whereby non-recombining genomes experience irreversible fitness decline due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations. MR has been a main hypothesis for sexual reproduction as well as many other biological phenomena. We now ask whether the fitness decline can indeed be stopped if an asexual population turns sexual to become recombining. The possible fitness decline under recombination is referred to as Ohta’s Ratchet (OR). In comparison, MR is more effective in driving fitness reduction than OR, but only in a restricted parameter space of mutation rate, population size and selection. Outside of this space, the two ratchets are equally effective or, alternatively, neither is sufficiently powerful. Furthermore, beneficial mutations can affect the population fitness, which may diverge between the two ratchets, but only in a small parameter space. Since recombination plays a limited role in driving fitness decline, the operation of MR could be far less common in nature than believed. A companion report (see Supplement) surveying the biological phenomena attributed to MR indeed suggests the alternative explanations to be generally more compelling.
